## Cognitive Load Theory
Explains why some topics are harder than others.

Problem solving is one of the hardest skills to learn.

Composed of the following types of load:
+ Intrinsic load: topic difficulty.
+ Germane load: prior knowledge.
+ Extraneous load: how information is presented by teachers. sometimes a picture is worth 1000 words.

## Metacognition
Metacognition is thinking about how you think.

+ Goal: Studying efficiently.
+ How: discover your learning style.

*How do you discover your learning style ?*

Good question, it was not covered in this lecture, In my experience a good way to do this is to ask a fellow student how they study or observe them while they are studying. If you notice differences try them out and evaluate for yourself if they work better or worse than your current technique, If you notice an improvement try to figure out if you can maximize the profit, by trying similar tactics or analyzing what senses, environment etc.. are being used.
