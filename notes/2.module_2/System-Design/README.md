# System Design

## What is a system ?

```plantuml
left to right direction

package "System" {
  [System Functionality]
  [Control Mechanism] -left-> [System Functionality] : Control
}

[Input] --> [System Functionality]
[System Functionality] --> [Output]
[Input] --> [Control Mechanism] : Feed-Forward
[Output] --> [Control Mechanism] : Feedback

```

## Model

A model is a **simplified representation** of the world (or part of a software system) from a specific **view**.

+ Simplified: Not the entire system
+ Representation: Notation used.
+ View: aspect modelled.

## UML (Unified Modelling Language)

+ In UML mostly **diagrams** are used as a representation to define models.
+ UML diagrams are **unambiguous**. in contrast to natural language.
