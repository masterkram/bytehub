4. natural person
:::

## GDPR applies only to data processed in one of these two ways:
- Personal data processed wholly or partly by automated means.
- Personal data processed in a non-automated manner which forms part of a "filing system".

## Privacy Design Strategies

Privacy by design more practical by strategies:
+ Bridge gap between data protection and system development.
+ GDPR above data protection regulation.

+ Taking data protection into account during software development via privacy by design `PbD`. During development life-cycle.
+ Software Architecture highest level of abstraction (functionality and quality attributes)
  + Difficult 'architectural tactics in software architecture domain for quality attributes'
  + attributes: `security`, `privacy protection`

GDPR focuses on specification, limitation, proportionality and consent "free flow of info"

:::info Tactic
An approach to privacy by design which contributes to the goal of an overarching privacy design strategy.
:::

:::info Privacy Design Strategy
Specifies a distinct architectural goal in privacy by design to achieve a certain level of privacy protection.

| Minimize | Hide | Separate | Abstract | Inform | Control | Enforce | Demonstrate |
| ----- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Exclude, Select, Strip, Destroy | Restrict, Mix, Obfuscate, Dissociate | Distributes, Isolate | Summarize, Group |
| Supply, Notify, Explain | Consent, Choose, Update, Retract | Create, Maintain, Uphold | Audit, Log, Report |


| Action | GDPR terms |
| ------ | ------------- |
| Operate| Adaptation, Alteration, Retrieval, Consultation, Use, Alignment |
| Store  | Organization, Structuring, Storage |
| Retain | opposite to Erasure |
| Collect | Collection, Recording |
| Share | Transmission, Dissemination |
| Change | Unauthorized third party (Alteration, Adaptation )|
| Breach | unauthorized third party (Retrieval) |

Other strategies: Hide, demonstrate, obfuscate, enforce (hash, encrypt, test, audit)

Strategies for: limitation, prevention, provision, insurance: agreed upon purposes.

### Minimize (Strategy)
- Minimal operation/collection on data
  - All or nothing processing (exclusive)
  - Granular privacy settings (selective)
- Data open to collection (identify types) prior to collection
  - Apply data stripping (remove not needed fields entirely)
  - Means deletion of purposeless data
- Minimize is about data itself rather than access to it: Hide is about the access.
- Tactics exclude, select, strip, destroy.

### Hide (Strategy)
- Limits access for storage, sharing and operation on personal data with purpose.
- Tactics: restrict, mix, obfuscate, dissociate.

### Separate (Strategy)
- Preventing correlation of personal data
- Tactics: distribute, isolate

### Abstract (Strategy)
- Limiting details as much as possible
- Processing correlation instead of data itself

### Inform (Strategy)
- Tactics: supply, notify, explain

### Control (Strategy)
- Tactics: consent, update, retract provide

### Enforce (Strategy)
Tactics:
+ Create (acknowledge value of privacy)
+ Maintain (considering privacy when updating features)
+ Uphold (make sure policies respect privacy)

### Demonstrate (Strategy)
+ Ensuring evidence of adhering to obligations
