# Intellectual property protection in a digitized world

## :moneybag: Physical vs Intellectual Property

Both physical and intellectual property have absolute rights.
That means that the right can be *upheld* against anyone, as opposed
to a personal right which rises out of a *contract* between two people.

European Patents are not granted for software *as such*. [^1]
A combination between hardware and software that complies with
the rules for patents (**new**, **inventive step**, **susceptible industrial application**) could be patented.
