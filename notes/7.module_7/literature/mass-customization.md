# Mass Customization

:::info Mass Customization
combines mass production with craft manufacturing.
Gives the advantage of custom products at relatively low prices.
:::

types of modularity:
+ Component sharing modularity
+ Component swapping modularity
+ Cut to fit modularity
+ Mix Modularity
+ Bus Modularity
+ Sectional modularity

A customized product must be designed to the customer's specifications. Identifying the point of initial customer involvement is critical to determining the degree of customization.

If the point of customer involvement is early then they can change more.

customers can be classified into archetypes:
+ Group 1 (`Fabricators`): customer involvement and modularity occurring during the design.
+ Group 2 (`Involvers`): customer involvement in product design during the desgin and fabrication stages but uses modularity during the assembly and delivery stages.
+ Group 3 (`Modularizers`): customer involvement during assembly and delivery but incorporates modularity in the design and fabrication stages (customers specify their requirements until the assembly and use stage)
+ Group 4 (`Assemblers`): brings both customer involvement and modularity to bear in the assembly and use stages. mass customization is provided to the customer by using modular components.

In short, mass customizers can be typed on the basis of two key dimensions: modularity and customer involvement.
