# Chapter 2

1. obtain sample from the population
2. measure the sample.
3. make conclusions about the population.

Two Reasoning Processes:
+ Deductive reasoning: general -> particular 
+ Inductive reasoning: particular -> general

:::tip goal of statistical inference
learn something about the population by studying a random sample.
Consider a property of the population $X$, measured by a single number $\Theta$
goal is to estimate the value of Theta with some function $T(x_1, ... x_n)$
:::

:::info Statistic
A function $T(x_1, ... x_n)$ of a random sample $\{x_1, ..., x_2\}$ is called a statistic.
The statistic $T(x_1, ..., x_n)$ is an estimate for $\Theta$

$T(x_1, ..., x_n) = \$
