# Probabilistic Reasoning

Logic is good, but we often don't know if something is true or false due to ignorance or intrinsic uncertainty.

## Full Joint Probability Distribution

A full joint probability distribution assigns a value for each random variable.

### Marginal Probability

The marginal probability is a probability of a subset of the random variables.
