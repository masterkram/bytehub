# History
+ `1956` First Use of the term `Artificial Intelligence` at the dartmouth summer research project.
+ `1956-1974`: "golden years", *shakey* robot.

## AI Winters and Spring
AI winters happen when inflated expectations of AI results are created
then there is a failure to meet those expectations. This results in reduced funding for the field.

Problems:
+ modelling commonsense knowledge.
+ intractability.
+ frame problem. (model what does not change in the environment)

The first AI winter happened from `1974-1980`
Then from `1980-1987`: expert systems
    + rule based systems for modelling the knowledge of experts.
    + brittle and difficult to maintain.
Then came the 2nd AI winter from `1987-1993`
Then from `1993-2011`
    + Increase in computing power. :computer:
    + Intelligent agents :robot:
    + Decision Theory
Finally from `2011-Now`
    + Big data enables Machine Learning.

## AI Pendulum

+ Oscillation between high expectations/funding and the opposite.
+ Oscillation of techniques: symbolic vs sub-symbolic/data oriented

Currently attention is being brought to bridging AI subfields to obtain better functioning AI.
