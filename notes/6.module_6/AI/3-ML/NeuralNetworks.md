## Perceptron

![perceptron](../../img/perceptron.png)

### Linear Perceptron
Models neurons:
+ Binary signals
+ Multiple inputs, one input
+ Send a signal to the output if inputs are sufficiently activated

:::info Activation
$$f(x;w) = h(w\cdot x), where h(a) = $$
:::

### Problems with Perceptron

+ Training is slow.
+ Does not generalize easily to more than 2 classes
