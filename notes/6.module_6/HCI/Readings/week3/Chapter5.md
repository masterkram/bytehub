# Surveys
+ one of the most commonly used research techniques.
+ strength: large number of responses quickly.
+ respondents can be geographically dispersed.
+ can help capture the "big picture"

## Survey Pros and Cons

### Pros
+ easy to collect data from a large number of people.
+ do not require (advanced) tools for development.
+ can be distributed easily.

### Cons
+ not very good at getting detailed data.
+ can lead to biased data. (recall bias: subject to interpretation or memory)
+ not possible to ask follow up questions.

`population of interest` == `target population` == `targeted users` (in hci)

the population of interest is filtered based on inclusion criteria such as profession, etc...

## Probabilistic Sampling

in a probability sample it is known exactly how likely it is to select a participant from the sample. 

### Stratification
+ A **stratified sample** is when you divide your entire population in separate subpopulations, known as *strata*.
+ A separate sample is drawn within each subpopulation.
+ stratification can help to have subgroups of the same size.

Example:
+ Survey of BIT students:
+ Subpopulations: first-years, second-years, third-years
+ Each year has different number of students, but stratified sample invites the same number from each year.

## Non-probabilistic Sampling
+ goal in HCI is not usually population estimates.
+ usually population is not well defined.

Non probabilistic sampling examples:
+ volunteer opt-in panels.
+ self-selected surveys.
+ snowball recruiting. (respondents recruit other people)

+ ask about demographic data to confirm validity.

*oversampling*: asking a large amount of people relative to the estimated population size, to avoid biases.

+ Random sampling of usage:
    + user is asked to fill a survey every 10th time they load a website.

+ Self selected survey:
    + respondent finds the survey online.
    + most natural data collection method.

## Developing Survey Questions

+ open ended questions.
+ close ended questions
    + scale (excellent - poor)
    + yes or no questions.

## Common problems
+ two questions in the same question.
+ use of negation
+ biased wording
+ hot button words

## Overall Structure
+ instructions
+ nice layout
+ not too long

## Online vs Paper
different people will have different access to both. So depends on the audience.

## Testing
1. review by colleagues and analysts
2. Interviews with potential respondents.
3. pilot study of the survey tool and implementation procedures.

## How to increase response rate:
+ offer reward
+ introductory letter
+ ease of submitting
+ multiple contacts with respondent

## Data analysis
1. quantitative and qualitative data is separated
2. data is cleaned: removed invalid responses.
3. if it is quantitative data use descriptive statistics
4. if it is qualitative data use content analysis (chapter 11)
