# Power Of Prototyping

+ Prototyping is a valuable technique.
+ Goal of prototyping: **Feedback**
+ A prototype is a question rendered as an artifact.
+ A prototype helps communication: helps everyone have a concrete understanding of what others are talking about.
+ Prototypes are and ought to be incomplete.
+ Prototyping is a strategy for efficiently dealing with things that are hard to predict.
+ Focus on goals of the design, don't settle for a fixed design.

## The rights of a prototype
+ not required to be complete
+ should be easy to change
+ gets to retire

## What do prototypes prototype
there are different kinds of prototypes:
+ feel: what will it look like?
+ implementation: what might it work like?
+ role: what might the experience be like?

## Goals In Prototyping

+ Maximize Learning and Communication axis
+ Minimize Time to create prototype axis

Prototypes can be used for large products:
+ planes 
+ ships
+ stores
etc...

It's important to have different ideas about the design to be able to find the best possible design.

## Costs of changes over time

The cost of changes increases exponentially overtime because:
+ people get used to the current product.
+ people develop things on top of your product, that can be broken.

Therefore most changes should be introduced early.
