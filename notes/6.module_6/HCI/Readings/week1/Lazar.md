# Intro To HCI Research

## Introduction
Research in HCI is fascinating and complex. It is fascinating Because there are so many questions
that change over time (due to technical advances). It is complex because research is taken from other fields and recycled for HCI
also it involves humans which are complex creatures.

## History
The field of HCI is between {{new Date().getFullYear() - 1982}} and {{new Date().getFullYear() - 1972}} years old.

## Types Of HCI Research Contributions

The field of HCI draws on many disciplines:
+ CS
+ Sociology
+ Psychology
+ Communication
+ Human Factors Engineering
+ Rehabilitation Engineering

The research from these disciplines is modified for use in HCI research.
The majority of HCI research falls into either empirical research or artifact contributions.

## Changes in topics of HCI research over time
+ original HCI research was about how ppl interacted with simple office automation programs: word processing, database and statistical software. 
+ Then research was increased into the fields of communication.
+ Then focus shifted towards user generated content.
+ now focused on collaboration, connections, emotion and communication.

## Changes in HCI research methods over time

New approaches to data collection available:
+ sensors
+ crowdsourcing
+ eye-tracking
+ facial electromyography

## The nature of interdisciplinary research in HCI
It is challenging to combine all the disciplines that HCI draws from because
they have different cultures and have different focuses for their reserach.

## Who is the audience for your research
+ other reserchers
+ UI/UX developers
+ companies
+ policy-makers

## Inherent Trade-Offs in HCI
+ accept better solutions instead of optimal solutions.
+ multiple stakeholders that can't all be satisfied.
+ design is not simple and it's not an optimization problem.
