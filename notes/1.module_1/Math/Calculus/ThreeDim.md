# Three dimensional coordinate systems.
additional to x and y axes there is also a z axis in three dimensional coordinate systems.

### Coordinate planes:
Coordinate planes are planes that pass through two axes.

These are the coordinate planes in three dimensions:
+ xz-plane (y = 0)
+ xy-plane (z = 0)
+ yz-plane (x = 0)

### Distance
::: info Definition
The distance between the points $P(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $Q(x_2, y_2, z_2)$
is defined as $|PQ| = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}$

### Spheres
::: info Definition
A sphere with center P and radius $r \ge 0$ is defined as the set of all points $X \in \mathbb{R}^3$ with distance r to P.
:::

+ If P = (a,b,c) then (x,y,z) is on the sphere whenever $\sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 + (z - c)^2} = r$ (the point (x,y,z) is at r distance from p so its in the sphere)

+ This is equivalent to $(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 + (z - c)^2 = r^2$
