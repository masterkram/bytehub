# Book Summary

## Chapter 1: Business management Research.

### Characteristics of research:
+ Data are collected systematically.
+ Data are interpreted systematically.
+ There is a clear purpose: to find something.

### Characteristics of Business research:
+ It is how managers draw knowledge from other disciplines.
+ Most managers only allow research when they see a commercial advantage.
+ the research has to have a practical consequence (an action that can be done in the company based on the research).

### Knowledge creation models:
+ **Model 1**: academic, emphasizes fundamental rather than applied, focus on utilization of the research.
+ **Model 2**: emphasizes relevant knowledge, that is usable in practice. Develops on top of model 1.
+ **Model 3**:  emphasizes the importance of broader issues of humanity in research.

### Types of research:
| Name | Purpose | Context | Results | Relevant For |
| ---- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------------ |
| (basic, fundamental, pure) research | expand knowledge of processes of business and management| University | universal principles | society |
| applied research | improve understanding of problem | organizations | solution to problem | manager(s) |

## Chapter 2.4: Turning ideas into research projects.
### Writing research questions:
*Goldilocks test*: check if the key words used in the research are not
too hard or too easy to research.

*general focus research question*: start with a more general question that you adjust: make more detailed.

### Writing research objectives:
Research objectives are statements that explain what you want to accomplish with your research. Research objectives are more formal and specific.

### Theory
::: info Theory
a formulation regarding the cause and effect relationships between two or more variables, which may or may not have been tested. - (Gill and Johnson)
:::

Ways of developing a theory:
+ **deductive approach**: you develop a theory and then you test it with data.
+ **inductive approach**: you have data and you build a theory on top of it.

## Chapter 3: Critically reviewing the literature.
### Critical Review
A critical review is reading the current scientific literature related 
to your research. Then you write the main theories and critique them.

It can help your research with:
+ defining questions and objectives.
+ highlight research possibilities.
+ justify your research.
+ avoiding repeating work.
+ gain insight to research approaches.

Types of literature:
+ primary: first occurrence of work.
+ secondary: subsequent publication of primary literature.
+ tertiary: provides primary and secondary literature: dictionaries

## Chapter 4: Research Philosophies.
 
## Chapter 5: Formulating the research design.

## Chapter 6: Negotiating access and research ethics.

## Chapter 12.1 - 12.4: Analyzing quantitative data.
quantitative data are basically measurements.

Things to consider while analyzing quantitative data:
+ type of data (level of numerical measurement);
+ format in which your data will be input to the analysis software;
+ impact of data coding on subsequent analyses (for different data types);
+ need to weight cases;
+ methods you intend to use to check data for errors.

Data Types:
+ Categorical data: not numerical, but values can be classified.
    + Descriptive data: cannot be ranked, count of the occurrences in each category.
    + Ranked data: values can be classified and ranked within a class or category.
+ Quantifiable data: measured numerically as quantities.
    + Continuous data: data values can take any value.
    + Discrete data: can be measured precisely often integer.



## Chapter 14: Writing and presenting your project report.
Suggested Structure:
+ Abstract
+ Introduction
+ Literature review
+ Method
+ Results
+ Conclusions
+ References
+ Appendices

### Abstract:
short summary of the report.
It should have 4 paragraphs.

the paragraphs should answer:
1. What were my research questions, and why were these important?
2. How did I go about answering the research questions?
3. What did I find out in response to my research questions?
4. What conclusions do I draw regarding my research questions?

### Introductory Chapter:
Gives the reader an idea about the central issue of your research.
It should include the *research questions* and *research objectives*
