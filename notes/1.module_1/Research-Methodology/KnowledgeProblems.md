# Knowledge Problems

## Solving:

### Do activity: (tasks)
get an overview of activities you need to solve the problem.

Support Tools:
+ Gantt charts: dependencies & parallel in time.
+ Kanban/Scrum: For agile projects. evaluate each iteration.

### Discover activity: (knowledge)
find knowledge you require to solve the problem.
search for relevant knowledge problems.
results in a list of research questions.

### Decide Activity: (scope)
select the key areas you will focus on.
state the limits of your research.
Make use of a theoretical framework.

### Types of problem analysis activities:
+ Detailed problem analysis.
+ Search for causes.
+ Search for known solutions.

## Causes:
+ evidence based causal relationship.
+ context related causes.

## Explanatory analysis:
+ variables
+ relationships (+/- increase or decrease with variable)
+ research population
+ A conceptual model visualizes the relationship between variables.
+ Independent variables influence a dependent variable.

::: warning
A conceptual model is different from a problem cluster.
the model has variables instead of problems
example: (research model): `delivery speed` (problem cluster): `slow delivery speed`

Data Types:
| Type | Name | Properties | Example |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ------- |
| Qualitative | Nominal | data used for naming or labeling variables with no ranking | types of cars on the road |
| Qualitative | Ordinal | categorical data with an order | grades (A, B, C, D, E, or F) |
| Quantitative | Interval | operations(+,-), equal intervals between data points, 0 is arbitrary | temperature, with celsius 0 is arbitrary temperature can be negative |
| Quantitative | Ratio | operations(+,-,*,/), equal intervals between data point, 0 is absolute, non negative | Height, cannot be negative |

Check if a relationship is causal:
+ Sequence of events.
+ Statistical relationship.
