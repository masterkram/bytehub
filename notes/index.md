## What is Bytehub ?

Bytehub is a community based website, which publishes articles with the goal of helping students.
This community takes time to write summaries that are relevant to everyone taking the courses of BIT.

On the technical side, this website is what is known as a _markdown driven website_.
using the static site generator [vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/).
We can generate `html` pages which would otherwise by using a simple markdown syntax.

We write all of our documents in markdown which are then compiled to html which you are reading now.
