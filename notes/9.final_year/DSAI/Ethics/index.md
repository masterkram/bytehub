# Ethics

We need to make sure that the **purpose** put into the machine is the purpose which **we really want.**

 ⇒ AI is designed, AI is an artefact

Ethics should be included in the design.

## Approaches to AI:

- Top down
    - abstract thinking
    - formal logic
    - deduction
- Bottom up
    - build a machine that is a copy of the brain and let it think.

Artificial Intelligence:

- adaptability
- interaction
- autonomy

## Ethical Theories

- Consequentialism
- Deontology
- Virute Ethics

|  | Consequentialism | Deontology | Virtue Ethics |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Description | An action is right if it promotes the best consequences, i.e max happiness | An action is right if it is in accordance with a moral rule of principle | An action is right if it is what a virtuous person would do in such circumstances. |
| Central Concern | The results matter, not the actions themselves | Persons must be seen as ends and maynever be used as means | Emphasise the character of the agent making the actions. |
| Guiding Value | good (often seen as max happiness | Right (rationality is doing one’s moral duty) | Virtue (leading to the attainment of audaimonia) |
| Practical Reasoning | The best for most (means-end resoning) | Follow the rule (rational reasoning) | Practice human qualities |
| Deliberation Focus | Consequences (What is outcome of action?) | Action (Is action compatible with some imperative) | Motives (is action motivated by virtue) |

## Taking Responsiblility

- In Design
    - Ensuring that development proesses take into account ethical and societal implicatio of AI as it integrates and replaces traditional systems and social structures.
- By Design
    - Integration of ethical reasoning abilities as part of the behaviour of artificial autonomous systems
- For Designers
    - Research integrity of researchers and manufacturers and certification mechanisms.

### Ethics In Design

ART 

- Accountability
    - Explanation and justification
    - Design for values
- Responsibility
    - Autonomy
    - Chain of responsible actors
    - Human-like AI
- Transparency
    - Data and processes
    - Not just about algorithms

- Doing the right thing
- Doing it right
- Design for values
- Design for all

### Ethics By Design

Can AI artifacts be build to be ethical?

1. value alignment
2. how to behave
3. how to implement
