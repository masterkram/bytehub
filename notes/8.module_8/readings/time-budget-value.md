# Delivering Large Scale IT projects on time, budget and value

+ Large IT efforts often cost much more than planned.
+ *black swans* = projects that go so badly that they threaten the existence of the company.
+ *black swans* in IT are projects: where $actual\_cost - budget > 200\% budget$

## Four ways of improving project performance

goal: maximize chances of delivering within expected time, budget and value.

methodology is called `value assurance`:
+ focusing on **managing strategy and stakeholders** instead of exclusively concentrating on budget and scheduling

+ mastering **technology and project content** by securing critical internal and external talent

+ building **effective teams** by aligning their incentives with the overall goals of projects

+ excelling at **core project-management practices**, such as short delivery cycles and rigorous quality checks

### Managing Strategy And Stakeholders
Strategy :
+ have a clear view of the value of the project.
+ maintain focus on the business objectives.

Stakeholders:
+ involve client and other stakeholders from the beginning of the development process.
+ good management of internal and external stakeholders:
  + check the opinion of the stakeholders on the project (client and supplier).
  + continually check the alignment of software with the business needs of the client.
  + when dealing with vendors (example: servers, software component, etc...) do not only consider the price, but assess the risks involved with maintainability, customer service etc...

### Technology and Project Content
+ draw on expert help as needed.
+ team understands both technical and business problems.
+ assign high performing experts during the length of the project.

### Effective Teams
+ common vision.
+ shared team processes.
+ high performance culture.
+ common (financial) incentive structure aligned with the project goal.


### Core Project Management Practices
+ establish process for requirements engineering and change requests.
+ short delivery lifecycle
+ few strong gates in the project. `gates = Project Gates are key points in a project where a formal review of the project's current state is performed.`

## Assessing the black swan risk
To avoid starting a black swan project analyze prospects before starting.

Diagnostics for all projects of a company(past, present and future):
+ health of the project in terms of value-assurance 4 dimensions.
+ relative prospects when compared with the outcomes of a reference class of similar projects.
