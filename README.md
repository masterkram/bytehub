## Development

### Requirements
+ [Node.js 10+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
+ [yarn v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)

### Installation
```bash
yarn install
yarn run dev
```
### Using Vuepress

Do NOT use whitespaces in the Markdown files, neither in the foldernames.

Please read more about Vuepress's markdown syntax [here](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/markdown.html#markdown-extensions).

The following plugins that extend vuepress's markdown are installed:
+ [mathjax](https://www.mathjax.org/) For LaTeX use in markdown.
+ [mermaidjs](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) Used for quick diagrams in markdown.
+ [plantuml](https://plantuml.com/) For UML diagrams.

## Deployment
+ Master is automatically deployed to production by netlify.
+ Open pull request branches are also deployed for staging.
