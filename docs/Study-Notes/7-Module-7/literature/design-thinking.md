### Inspiration
What's the business problem ?
Where is the opportunity?
What has changed (or may soon change)?

Look at the world:
+ observe what people do
+ how they think
+ what they need.

### Ideation

+ sketches
+ scenarios
+ describe the customer journey.
+ communicate.
+ prototype and test.

### Implementation
execute the vision.

## How to implement Design Thinking in a company.

+ Involve design thinkers at the start of the innovation process.
+ Human centered approach. (factor in human behavior)
+ try early and often. (create an expectation of rapid experimentation and prototyping).
+ ask consultants.
+ blend big and small projects
+ budget to the pace of innovation.
+ find talent anyway you can
+ design for the cycle (make sure employees stay for the whole project)
