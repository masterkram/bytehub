## How to Value Perpetuities
The annual rate of return on a perpetuity is equal to the promised annual payment divided by the present value: 

$\text{return} = \frac{\text{cash flow}}{\text{present value}}$

The present value of a perpetuity can easily be found by flipping the formula:

$PV = \frac{\text{cash flow}}{\text{discount rate}}$

Sometimes you need to calculate the value of a perpetuity that starts payments several years from now. In three years the endowments will be worth:

$1 / r = $10 billion.

That is what it will be worth in the future. To find today's value we need to multiply by the three year discount factor 1 / (1 + r) ^ 3 = .751.

## How to Value Annuities

1. Perpetual stream of $1 starting at the end of the first year.
2. Perpetual stream of $1 starting 4 years from now. Same payments as 1, but with a delay of 3 years.
3. Three-year annuity of $1.

## Valuing Annuities Due
**annuity due** = stream of payments starting immediately

an annuity due is worth (1 + r) times the value of an ordinary annuity
