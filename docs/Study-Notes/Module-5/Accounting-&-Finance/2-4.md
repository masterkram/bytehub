# 2-4 How Interest Is Paid and Quoted

**semianually** = twice a year

If the interest is 10% compounded semiannually, it is equivalent to 10.25% compounded anually. The *effective annual interest rate* on the bond is 10.25%. -> 100$ x 1.05 x 1.05 = 110,25$.

**APR** = annual percentage rate

If for example could be that a loan can have an APR of 12% with interest to be paid monthly. By this the bank means that each month you need to pay one-twelth of the annual rate. So each month you will have to pay 12% / 12 = 1% interest a month. The bank is *quoting* a rate of 12%, but the actual annual interest rate on the loan is $1.01^12 - 1 = 12,68%$.

Always distinguish between the *quoted* annual interest rate and the *effective* annual rate. This is because the annual rate is often calculated as the total annual payment divided by the number of payments in the year. When interest is paid once a year, the quoted rate = the effective rate. In the case of interest being paid more frequently -> effective interest rate > quoted interest rate.

If you invest \$1 at a rate of *r* per year compounded *m* times a year. Your investment at the end of the year will be worth $ [1 + (r / m)] ^ m $ and the effective interest rate is $ [1 + (r / m) ] ^ m - 1 $.
