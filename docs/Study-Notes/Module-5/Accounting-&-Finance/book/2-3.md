# 2-3 Growing Perpetuities and Annuities

## Growing Perpetuities

If you have a perpetuity that has
+ a discount rate of 10% a year
+ an annual amount of 1$

Because of the previous chapters we will know that the present value of this perpetuity is: $PV = \frac{annual amount}{discount rate} = \frac{1}{0,10} = 10\$$

When a perpetuity grows on a annual basis with a certain percentage the new formula will be $PV = \frac{annual amount}{discount rate - grow rate}$. Let's keep the sample as above but a growth rate of 7%. The new present value will be $PV = \frac{1}{0,10 - 0.07} = \frac{1}{0,03} = 33,3\$$.
