# 8-3 Validity and Role of CAPM

CAPM is the best model of risk-return we have.
however it has it's quirks.

## CAPM test.

The CAPM predicts that the risk premium should increase in proportion to beta. 

critics of CAPM:
+ the slope of the line has been mostly flat in recent years. low beta portfolio performance = high beta portfolio performance.
+ capm predicts that beta is the *only* reason that expected returns differ.

## Assumptions behind CAPM
+ US treasury bills are risk free.
  + even if little chance of default
  + still not a guaranteed return because there may be inflation higher than than the return of bills.
+ investors can borrow money at the same rate of interest at which they can lend.
  + generally borrowing rates are higher than lending.
