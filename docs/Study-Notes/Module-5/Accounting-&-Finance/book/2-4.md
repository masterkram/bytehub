# 2-4 How Interest Is Paid and Quoted

**semianually** = twice a year

If the interest is 10% compounded semiannually, it is equivalent to 10.25% compounded anually. The *effective annual interest rate* on the bond is 10.25%. -> 100$ x 1.05 x 1.05 = 110,25$.

**APR** = annual percentage rate

If for example could be that a loan can have an APR of 12% with interest to be paid monthly. By this the bank means that each month you need to pay one-twelth of the annual rate. So each month you will have to pay 12% / 12 = 1% interest a month. The bank is *quoting* a rate of 12%, but the actual annual interest rate on the loan is $1.01^{12} - 1 = 12,68%$.

Always distinguish between the *quoted* annual interest rate and the *effective* annual rate. This is because the annual rate is often calculated as the total annual payment divided by the number of payments in the year. When interest is paid once a year, the quoted rate = the effective rate. In the case of interest being paid more frequently -> effective interest rate > quoted interest rate.

If you invest \$1 at a rate of *r* per year compounded *m* times a year. Your investment at the end of the year will be worth $ [1 + (r / m)] ^ m $ and the effective interest rate is $ [1 + (r / m) ] ^ m - 1 $.

## 🔁 Continious Compounding
There is no limit to how frequently interest could be paid. It could be weekly (m = 52) or even daily (m = 365). There is no limit to how frequently interest can be paid. 

When *m* approaches $∞$ the interest rate $[1 + (r/m)]^m$ approaches $e^r$(the base for natural logarithms). So \$1 invested at a continiously compounded rate of *r* will grow to $e^r$ by the end of the first year. By the end of *t* years it will grow to $e^{r*t}$.

Example: 17% continuosly compounded = $e^{0.17} = 1.185 = 18,5%$. The PV(present value) of the **continuous** cash flow stream is 100/.17 = 588,24\$.

Investors are willing to pay more for the continuous cash payments because the cash starts to flow instantly.
