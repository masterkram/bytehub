# IP Part 2

## European Database Directive
database = collection of independent works, data or other materials _arranged in a systematic or methodical way_ and individually accessible by electronic or other means

database protection = the way the database has been arranged (structure, because this is the intellectuel creation) is protected, the contents of the database is not protected, some of the content in the database might be protected by copyright
+ there must have been a _substantial investment_ in preventing extraction of the database

if you create a database that meets the definition of a database and a substantial investment has been made, this would be your rights:
+ prevent extraction and/or re-utilization of the whole or of a **substantial** part
+ prevent repeated and **systematic** extraction and/or re-utilization of **insubstantial** parts
+ term of protection: 15-16 years after completion
+ spin-off theory: databases created as a by product of the maker's main activity are excluded from database protection, when you invest in it, it will
+ regular copyright:
    + transfer and license regime
    + first sale doctrine
    + no registration required for database protection
