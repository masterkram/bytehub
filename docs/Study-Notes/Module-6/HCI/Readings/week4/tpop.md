# The Power Of Prototyping

:::theorem Prototype
A prototype is a rapidly created approximation of a design idea, such that you can quickly get feedback and learn.
:::

+ question rendered as an artifact.
+ A way of communicating with stakehodlers.
+ Prototypes nearly always are incomplete (good).
+ prototyping is a strategy for efficiently dealing with things that are hard to predict. (realizing things about the design that need a change)

Focus on the goals **of** the design, rather than try to argue for a concrete design.

Prototypes should be:
+ not required to be complete
+ easy to change
+ can be changed to another prototype

Prototypes models:
+ Feel: what might it look like?
+ Implementation: what might it work like?
+ Role: What might the experience be like?
