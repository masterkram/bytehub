*the part of managment that deals with efficiently and effectivley organizing processes by means of design, managment and optimization.*

### Operations research

## Historical perspective

+ JD Rockefeller OIl
+ Cornelius Vanderbilt Railroads/Shipping
+ JP MorganL Banking, Steel, GE 
+ Andrew Carnegie, Steel

All were:
- visionaries
- creators
- industrial innovators
- ruthless, courageous businessmen
- monopolists, captains of industry
- fierce competitors

#### Example: Henry Ford

made a affordable car.
Model-T using the Ford assembly line

### first industrial revolution
the spinning jenny invention
in the textile industry
`+ output - cost`

steam engine (James Watt) driving force of the industrial revolution.

labour division (Adam Smith)
> specialization of workers increases productivity

Interchangable parts Honore Blanc, Eli Whitney
standardization of parts increases quality, production speed, efficient repairing. (rifles)

### second industrial revolution

Electrification

scietific managment(taylorism) following adam smith / charles babbage

best working practices
time and motion studies
differential peice rate system

Henry Gantt: gant chart
Gilbreth: Time and motion studies

Diversification

Economies of scale (reduce costs, improve efficency) => Economies of scope (two or more priducts) reduce risk

Market Pull
economic dev

tech push
automation
manufacturing planning and control
new technologies (3d printing)

### Operations reasearch and operations managment

second world war: logistics problems

### System dynamics

bullwhip effect

products that are diverse in quality makes it slower

stable production process with as little variation as possible is desirable

## Re-discovering manufacturing

closed loop supply chains consist of the primary supply chain and secondary supply loops for the whole product, its componets or its materials

## Changing design paradigms

cradle to grave => cradle to cradle

product returns represent a value stream not just a waste stream

## Netherlands

gateway to europe

+ geografical position
+ rotterdam depth
+ exellent main ports
+ network of hinterland connections
+ logistic service providers networks
+ legislative framework and customs
+ established knowledge centers

Logistics / transport related GDP:
42 billion Euros `+- 7.5%` of GDP

## Urban Distribution
everyone orders online,
expecting same day or next orders

cities want to restrict freight truck traffic

## The golden age of service

+ from products to service
+ (spare parts, repairs) great source of revenues and profit
+ market size: aftermarkets 5x > OEM Business (*original equipment manufacturer*)
+ high margins: 24% of business revenues generates 45% of gross profits

## Healthcare

improve on:
- waiting time
- costs
- waste
- overtime
- cancellations
- space

by optimizing:
- quality of care
- quality of labor
- productivity

#### example: CHOIR

help care providers with
IT solutions / consulting.

reduce wait time with planning of surgeries
